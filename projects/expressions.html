			<a href="#openModal">Drank too much, got the sickness
			Pray to God and his son for forgiveness</a>
				<div id="openModal" class="modalDialog1">
					<div>
						<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close1">X</a>
						<h2>"Drank too much, got the sickness
						Pray to God and his son for forgiveness"</h2>
						<p>Keshi starts by saying he’s already in a bad state by drinking too much he probably feels sick.</p>
						<p>He also mentions at this point, he asks for forgiveness from God and his son (Jesus). He could also be asking for a sort of relief or salvation from them.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			<a href="#openModal2">Same crew but another mistress</a>
				<div id="openModal2" class="modalDialog2">
						<div>
							<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close2">X</a>
							<h2>"Same crew but another mistress"</h2>
							<p>2 soon is a song about recovering from a breakup. In the song, Keshi is telling how he coped with the breakup and whether is it wrong if he wants to move on from the feelings of sadness faster.</p>
						</div>
				</div>
			Every day, every night getting wasted
			But I miss you, what did I do?
			<a href="#openModal3">Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you</a>
				<div id="openModal3" class="modalDialog3">
						<div>
							<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close3">X</a>
								<h2>"Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you"</h2>
								<p>Keshi explains he “fucked it up”. How he did it is unclear but based on the line, we can guess that he didn’t take what his ex was saying seriously or he belittled/insulted her.</p>
								<p>She left after that.</p>
						</div>
				</div>
			If I pull through, is it too soon?
			Turn it up, close my eyes, then I'm with you
		</p>

		<p>
			Yo Marvin, stop callin'
			Sad Iverson is ballin'
			In the corner of a room by himself
			<a href="#openModal4">You are nothin' but an empty shell</a>
				<div id="openModal4" class="modalDialog4">
						<div>
							<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close4">X</a>
								<h2>"You are nothin' but an empty shell"</h2>
								<p>At this point, Keshi switches to 3rd person and he talks about himself as if he’s another person.</p>
								<p>He’s saying he is nothing but an empty shell. Every night he is miserable and all the one night stands or escort he pays feels hollow, empty and fake.</p>
								<p>Uncomparable to what he felt in the relationship.</p>
						</div>
				</div>
			Every night, he going down to hell
			Fake love in a shit hotel
			Can't believe how far he fell
			You weak on the floor so you call her cell
		</p>

		<p>
			<a href="#openModal5">"How you been?", "How you doing?" You been good, I been drinking Way too much, you think that I'd be over you, over you, over you</a>
				<div id="openModal5" class="modalDialog5">
						<div>
							<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close5">X</a>
								<h2>"'How you been?', 'How you doing?'' You been good, I been drinking Way too much, you think that I'd be over you, over you, over you"</h2>
								<p>In this part of the song, Keshi begins with the usual questions that someone would ask their ex. But he sings “You been good, I been drinking way too much..”</p>
								<p>When Keshi sang this, he sang it in a way as if to say he did not hold his composure well and immediately begins to tell her all the things he’s been doing to himself after she left. All the self-destructive habits that could “distract” him from thinking about her.</p>
						</div>
				</div>

			(Eight calls, all you)
			But I think about it every day, yeah
			<a href="#openModal6">Yeah, I never missed her anyways Yeah, I never missed her anyways</a>
				<div id="openModal6" class="modalDialog6">
						<div>
							<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close6">X</a>
								<h2>"Yeah, I never missed her anyways Yeah, I never missed her anyways"</h2>
								<p>keshi repeating the lyric twice suggests that he actually does miss her, and this is just him telling himself/trying to convince himself that he doesn’t.</p>
						</div>
				</div>

		<p>
			Drank too much, got the sickness
			Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
			Same crew but another mistress
			Every day, every night getting wasted
			But I miss you, what did I do?
			Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you
			If I pull through, is it too soon?
			Turn it up, close my eyes, then I'm with you

		<p>
			<a href="#openModal7">Call me up
			Stay over and we'll call it love</a>
				<div id="openModal7" class="modalDialog7">
						<div><a href="#close" title="Close" class="close7">X</a>
								<h2>"Call me up Stay over and we'll call it love"</h2>
								<p>Keshi wants her to call him.</p>
								<p>He also wants the girl to be with him and we can pretend things are okay again, even if just a while.</p>
						</div>
				</div>
			
			Don't matter if it fucks me up
			The alcohol is not enough
		</p>

		<p>
			<a href="#openModal8">Fuck pride and the other guy I cried, I don't 'member why</a>
				<div id="openModal8" class="modalDialog8">
						<div><a href="#close" title="Close" class="close8">X</a>
								<h2>"Fuck pride and the other guy I cried, I don't 'member why"</h2>
								<p>Keshi is disregarding his pride and disregarding her new partner. Because he doesn’t care at this point.</p>
								<p>He’s so in his head and sadness, he’s crying and is misrable but he can’t remember why he’s sad and crying in the first place.</p>
						</div>
				</div>
			Tonight, I'ma try to hide
			No slide, get frostbite
			Eight calls, all you, eight ball, all you
			Yeah, I never missed her anyways
			Yeah, I never missed her anyways
		</p>

		<p>
			Drank too much, got the sickness
			Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
			Same crew but another mistress
			Every day, every night getting wasted
			But I miss you, what did I do?
			Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you
			If I pull through, is it too soon?
			Turn it up, close my eyes, then I'm with you
